[https://izazoo.com](https://izazoo.com/) shows random graphs created by a single user. The genesis for a graph can be anything interesting or noteworthy that gains meaning by showing how it is related to other things. There are very few requirements and restrictions in creating a graph: nodes have titles and edges have descriptions, and both can have a URL that the node or edge refers to. A graph should have at least 2 nodes and an edge joining them.

Once the data for the graph has been added, the user can position the nodes and edges in a way that they feel best represents the contained information.

Current limitations of the project:
* Single user only
* Creating a graph is too tedious for the average user
* No smartphone support
